# Stencil + React Typescript Compatibility Bug

I originally intended to make this repo a reproduction of [`stencil/core#827`](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/827) but ended up running into additional issues, so it is also a reproduction of [`stencil/core#927`](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/973) as well.

## Running

1.  Clone the repo
2.  `yarn install` (must use `yarn` due to workspaces)
3.  `cd packages/demo-components`
4.  `yarn build`
